# Unfortunately, there's no way to define shared variables in the Ansible
# playbook. Moreover, there's no way to do so using host_vars or group_vars
# mechanism, since we need them to be defined for both localhost and dynamic
# inventory, and localhost is not a part of any Ansible group.
#
# So the best we can do is to define them here, and include the file in
# every play we need them.
